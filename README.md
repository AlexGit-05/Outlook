This R script automates email attachment retrieval from Microsoft Outlook by using the RDCOMClient package to establish a COM (Component Object Model) connection with Outlook. It first connects to Outlook, navigates to a specific folder within the inbox, and then searches for emails within a specified date range (September 7, 2022). For each email found, it checks for attachments, specifically looking for Excel files (identified by the ".xls" extension). When it finds Excel attachments, it stores their filenames in a variable, selects the second file from the list (Files[2]), saves it as a temporary file, and then reads it into R using the readxl package, skipping the first two rows of data. The script essentially creates a pipeline for automatically extracting data from Excel attachments in Outlook emails, making it useful for automated data processing workflows.
